                <p>Established in 2001, Tsunami is still a big wave washing through Clapham. Following a full refurbishment in
                April 2015 this flagship restaurant has brought its whole look up-to-date rivalling the best in Central
                London.
                With stunning wooden screens surrounding luxurious leather seating, it certainly sets the scene for an
                exquisite
                meal or delicious cocktail. With a late license, this is certainly the place to go.</p>
